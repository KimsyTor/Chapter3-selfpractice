# Exercise 3: Pirate's Treasure Hunt

# A pirate is searching for a treasure. 
# The treasure is buried somewhere on a desert island.
# Help the pirate find the treasure using Python. :D

# Requirements:

# 1. Set a variable 'steps_taken' to 0. 
#    This will keep track of how many steps the pirate has taken.

# 2. Create a variable called 'treasure_location' 
#    Set the value to be a random number between 10 and 30. 
#    This is where the treasure is buried.

# 3. Create a while loop where the pirate will 
#    keep walking until they reach the treasure.

# 4. Inside the while loop, increment 'steps_taken' by 1 for each iteration.

# 5.  Occasionally make the pirate take an extra step. 
#     You do this by adding a random number to 'steps_taken.'
#     There should be a 10 percent chance of this happening.

# 6. If 'steps_taken' is equal to 'treasure_location', 
#    print a message saying "The pirate found the treasure!" and break the loop.

# 7. If 'steps_taken' exceeds 'treasure_location'
#    print a message saying "The pirate has walked too far!" and break the loop.

# 8. Add your own creative spin to the program.

# Helpful Tips:

# - To generate a random number between 10 and 30, use import the random class in Python.

# - Remember to increment 'steps_taken' inside the while loop. 
#   If you forget to do this, it will create an infinite loop.

# - Use the 'break' statement to exit the loop when the condition is met.
