# Exercise 2: The Lucky Lottery

# Let's build a fun lottery game! 

# Your task is to generate random lottery numbers and see if the user can guess them. 
# If they do, they hit the jackpot!

# Requirements:

# 1. Ask the user how many lottery numbers they want to guess. Let's say they choose 5.

# 2. Generate exactly that many random numbers between 1 and 50. 
#    - These are your winning numbers, so keep them safe in a list.

# 3. Now, it's the user's turn to guess. Let them enter their guesses one by one.

# 4. Once all guesses are in, reveal the winning numbers and the user's guesses by printing both lists.

# 5. Time for the moment of truth! 
#    - Compare the user's guesses with the winning numbers and print how many they got right.

# 6. If the user guessed all the numbers correctly, celebrate their victory with congratulations.

# 7. Add your own creative spin to the program.

# Tips:
# - Import randint in Python
# - Try using the for-loop to help you repeat an action a certain number of times
# - The append() method is your friend when you want to add an item to a list
